# Why I Will Not Use My Face as a GitHub Profile Picture

## This Is Not a Professional Statement — It's a Personal One

Some ask why I don’t use my real face here, as if that’s the default — as if **every profile must perform** for recruiters or the public.

But GitHub isn't LinkedIn. It was never meant to be.  
And I’m not here to **package myself**.  
I’m here to **create** — freely, personally, and on my own terms.

## 🔧 GitHub Was Built for People, Not Products

Before it was a job portfolio site, GitHub was a place to:
- Build weird projects
- Fork cool ideas
- Collaborate casually
- Learn through breaking things

It was meant to be **personal**.  
Not a showroom. Not a job pitch. Not a headshot hub.

Putting a polished face on your profile pushes it closer to being a performance.  
And that’s exactly what I’m resisting.

## 🎨 Faces Kill Creativity

The moment you upload your face:
- You start thinking about how you’re perceived.
- You hesitate before uploading something rough or chaotic.
- You present instead of explore.

> A face invites self-consciousness.  
> Self-consciousness **kills experimentation**.  
> And without experimentation, creation dies.

I’d rather be underestimated and **free**, than "professional" and **edited**.

## 🧠 I Don’t Want to Be a Brand

Using your face implies branding:  
“Here I am. Recognize me. Trust this look.”

But I’m not here to sell myself.  
I’m not a product. I’m a person — one who thinks, builds, and questions.  
My face isn’t part of that equation.

## 🧱 Small Norms Become Walls

This might sound small — just a profile picture, right?

But when every space asks for your real face, it adds up.  
Suddenly, being anonymous is “unusual.”  
Being expressive is “unprofessional.”  
And being different is “wrong.”

> I want to keep this space human.  
> That means defending **freedom of identity** — even in the smallest ways.

## 💬 Final Words

This isn’t about hiding.  
It’s about protecting the rare spaces where creativity, messiness, and identity don’t have to be polished.

So no — I will not use my face here.  
Because GitHub is not a job interview.  
It’s my corner of the digital world to **build, learn, and express** — not to fit in.

If you want to know me, read my code.  
If you want to control me, good luck.
