# Why I Will Not Use My Face as a GitHub Profile Picture

## This Isn’t Just Personal — It’s Philosophical

There’s an expectation creeping across digital platforms:  
> Show your face, prove you’re real, look professional.

But I’m here to say: **No. Not here. Not on GitHub.**

Because GitHub remains one of the few places where creativity and logic take the front seat — and I refuse to sacrifice that for the illusion of “credibility” a face provides.

## 🛠 GitHub Is Not a Résumé Site

It started as a **personal playground**:
- A space to share passion projects, not polish.
- A space for experimentation, not presentation.
- A space where code mattered more than credentials.

Turning it into a place for clean portraits and self-marketing ruins the point.  
I’m not here to look presentable.  
I’m here to **build**, **break**, **learn**, and **think**.

## 🎨 Real Faces Limit Real Creativity

Uploading a face sounds harmless. But it **shifts your mindset**:
- You start wondering who’s watching.
- You hesitate to share messy or half-baked work.
- You subconsciously start *performing*.

> Creativity doesn't survive in performance.  
> It needs room, rough edges, and the freedom to be wrong.

Your real face, staring back, can police that freedom.

## 🤖 A Face Is *More* Boring Than the Default

Think about it.

Even GitHub’s **default identicons** — those little algorithm-generated patterns — are more expressive than a standard face:
- They’re abstract, random, sometimes even memorable.
- They signal "I’m here to create, not to pose."

But a face? Especially a clean, smiling, job-hunting face?

> It’s the most **predictable**, **sanitized**, and **creatively dead** choice you can make.  
> It says nothing except: *“I conform.”*

## 💡 I’m Not a Brand. I’m a Person Who Thinks

Faces are for marketing, sales, networking, and self-promotion.  
That’s not why I’m here.

I'm not a product — I'm a person with ideas.  
And I'd rather let those ideas represent me than a square-cropped photo of my head.

## 🧱 Small Pressures Become Big Walls

Sure — it’s “just a profile picture.”

But when every platform demands your face, you stop asking **why**.  
You start playing safe.  
You stop expressing identity in new ways.

> I believe in protecting freedom, even in the smallest acts of refusal.

If that means rejecting a cultural norm to defend creative space — then good.  
That’s exactly what I’ll do.

## 🧭 Final Word

This is a personal profile, on a platform built for personal projects.  
Not a corporate hallway. Not a networking stage. Not a headshot showroom.

So no — I will not upload my face.  
Because I believe in freedom.  
Because I believe in creativity.  
And because, let’s be honest —

> **My real face is more boring than the default icon.**
